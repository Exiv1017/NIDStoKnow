## **_Telemetry Fusion_**

In Lessons 1.1 and 1.2, we learned how **hybrid detection** combines multiple detection techniques and aligns with broader security frameworks.

Now we’ll look deeper into the data side of things — specifically how hybrid systems collect, merge, and interpret information from different sources. This process is known as **telemetry fusion**.

Telemetry fusion is the foundation that enables hybrid systems to think more intelligently, correlate diverse signals, and produce **context-aware alerts** that analysts can trust.

## **_What Is Telemetry in Cybersecurity?_**

Telemetry refers to the **data collected from systems, networks, and applications** that helps monitor activity, detect threats, and improve visibility.

As **IBM** describes, telemetry is essential for intrusion detection and prevention because it gives security systems the evidence they need to spot abnormal or malicious behaviors.

Common telemetry sources include:

* **Network telemetry:** Packet captures, NetFlow, and session logs.
* **Host telemetry:** System events, file changes, or process behavior.
* **Application telemetry:** HTTP requests, authentication logs, and API calls.
* **Cloud and identity telemetry:** Access patterns, token use, and virtual resource activity.

Each of these sources provides only a **partial view** of what’s happening — which is why hybrid systems fuse them together.

## **_The Concept of Telemetry Fusion_**

**Telemetry fusion** is the process of combining and correlating data from multiple sources to create a **complete and unified picture** of security activity.

According to **Microsoft**, layered defense works best when data from different layers—such as identity, endpoint, and network—feeds into a common analysis pipeline.
This concept extends directly into hybrid detection, where fusion acts as the **core logic layer** that connects signature-based and anomaly-based findings.

Telemetry fusion helps systems:

* **Correlate signals** from different detection engines.
* **Eliminate duplicates** and reduce alert noise.
* **Enhance context**, allowing better prioritization of real threats.
* **Provide historical insight** for investigations and post-incident analysis.

## **_How Telemetry Fusion Works_**

As described by **ScienceDirect**, hybrid IDS architectures often include multiple modules that gather and preprocess data before analysis.

A simplified workflow looks like this:

1. **Data Collection:** Logs, packets, and sensor outputs are gathered from multiple network and host sources.
2. **Normalization:** Data is standardized into a common format so that different systems can process it uniformly.
3. **Fusion Layer:** The hybrid system merges different telemetry streams, matching identifiers such as IP addresses, session IDs, or timestamps.
4. **Correlation Engine:** Cross-source correlations are performed — e.g., a suspicious process on a host that corresponds with an abnormal network connection.
5. **Contextualization:** Threat intelligence and historical data are layered in to determine whether the event is benign or malicious.

Through this pipeline, hybrid systems transform raw telemetry into **actionable intelligence**.

## **_Benefits of Telemetry Fusion in Hybrid Detection_**

**Stamus Networks** notes that modern IDS solutions benefit from correlating host and network perspectives, allowing analysts to understand not just *what* happened, but also *where*, *how*, and *why*.

Key benefits include:

* **Improved accuracy:** Fused telemetry gives more context, reducing false positives.
* **Broader visibility:** Provides cross-layer insight into attack paths.
* **Faster response:** Correlated events allow quicker triage and response actions.
* **Scalability:** Supports integration with SIEM and SOAR platforms for enterprise-wide monitoring.

In short, telemetry fusion makes hybrid detection **smarter, faster, and more contextual**.

## **_Challenges in Implementing Telemetry Fusion_**

Despite its advantages, telemetry fusion also poses some challenges:

* **Data overload:** Too much data can overwhelm detection engines and analysts.
* **Inconsistent formats:** Logs and telemetry from different vendors may not align.
* **Correlation complexity:** Matching signals from multiple layers requires advanced algorithms and tuning.
* **Privacy and compliance:** Collecting telemetry must follow legal and ethical guidelines (e.g., GDPR).

As **Fortinet** emphasizes, organizations must implement well-defined policies and scaling mechanisms to ensure that telemetry fusion strengthens—rather than complicates—security operations.

## **_Summary_**

Telemetry fusion is the **analytical backbone** of hybrid detection.
It gathers data from across systems, normalizes it, correlates events, and delivers unified, actionable alerts.

By blending telemetry from network, host, application, and cloud environments, hybrid detection achieves the situational awareness needed to detect complex, multi-stage attacks.

In the next module, we’ll move into **Correlation & Enrichment**, where you’ll learn how these fused data streams are prioritized and transformed into intelligent, context-rich detections.
