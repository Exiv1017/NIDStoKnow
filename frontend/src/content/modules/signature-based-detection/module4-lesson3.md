## **_Connection to the Previous Lesson_**

You explored today’s deployments. Now look ahead: hybrid, behavior, and AI working with signatures — using the same compact blocks.

## **_Why Hybrid_**

[[FlipCards]]
Known vs Unknown | Signatures excel on knowns; anomalies/behavior find new tactics.
Resilience | Multiple layers reduce misses and false positives.
Adaptation | Feedback turns anomaly finds into new signatures.

---

## **_Layers_**

[[Expandables]]
Signature | Deterministic matches for precision and speed.
Anomaly | Baselines detect deviations (exfil after hours, odd volumes).
Behavior | Sequences like brute‑force → privilege escalation → beaconing.
AI/ML | Triage clustering, false‑positive prediction, and assisted rule authoring.

## **_AI in Practice_**

[[Expandables]]
LLM‑Aided Rules | Convert intel reports/logs into draft signatures to shrink exposure windows.
Continuous Learning | Retrain models on fresh telemetry and outcomes to improve signal.
Guardrails | Keep humans‑in‑the‑loop and test before production rollout.

## **Summary**

[[Icons]]
 | Keep signatures — add anomaly and behavior |
 | Use AI to accelerate coverage, not replace experts |
 | Turn findings into tuned, testable rules |
