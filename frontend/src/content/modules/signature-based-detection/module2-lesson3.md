### **Overview**

While signature-based detection focuses on identifying known threats using predefined rules, modern intrusion detection systems (IDS) like **Suricata** and **Snort** extend this process through enhanced workflows. These techniques improve precision, reduce false positives, and provide deeper context about each event.

Extended workflows combine **signature logic**, **correlation**, **alert enrichment**, and **automation** to make detection more intelligent and adaptive.

## **_Connection to the Previous Lesson_**

You saw the five‑stage pipeline. This lesson shows how teams extend it with rule chaining, correlation, enrichment, and automation — using the same compact blocks.

## **_Extended Techniques_**

[[FlipCards]]
Flowbits / Chaining | Use state flags between rules to model multi‑step attacks (scan → exploit → beacon).
Correlation | Link alerts by IP/session/time to see sequences instead of isolated events.
Enrichment | Add metadata (priority, refs, tags) and fuse TI (e.g., AbuseIPDB, MISP) for context.
Automation | Pipe critical alerts to SOAR/firewalls for blocklists and workflows.

---

## **_Example: Rule Chaining_**

```
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"Possible Scan"; flowbits:set,scan_detected; sid:1001;)
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"Exploit Detected"; flowbits:isset,scan_detected; sid:1002;)
```

[[Expandables]]
What’s Happening | Rule 1 sets a flag when reconnaissance is seen.<br><br>Rule 2 only triggers if that flag exists, indicating escalation.
Why It Helps | Reduces noise and highlights true attack progressions.

---

## **_Tuning & Performance_**

[[Expandables]]
Thresholds & Suppressions | Trigger after N hits or ignore known‑safe sources to cut alert floods.
Rule Profiling | Identify expensive rules; simplify patterns; de‑duplicate overlaps.
Scoped Rule Sets | Apply different rule packs by zone/asset criticality.
