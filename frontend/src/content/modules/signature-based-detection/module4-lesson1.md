## **_Connection to the Previous Lesson_**

You’ve seen tools and pipelines. Now, how does signature detection show up in real deployments? Let’s keep the concise blocks.

## **_Where It’s Used_**

[[FlipCards]]
Cloud / Virtual Networks | Sensors monitor east‑west VM traffic; lightweight deploys capture exfiltration and web exploits.
Enterprise SOC | IDS alerts flow to SIEM; analysts triage with dashboards and correlations.
Edge / Mobile | Resource‑aware sensors provide visibility at remote or constrained sites.

---

## **_Typical Use Cases_**

[[Expandables]]
SQL Injection Detection | Custom rules match suspicious SQL patterns in HTTP requests; tuned to app context for low noise.
Data Exfiltration Clues | Outbound anomalies cross‑correlated with IDS hits confirm incidents faster.
Rule Lifecycle Ops | Write → Test → Stage → Deploy → Monitor → Retire; version control and rollbacks reduce risk.

---

## **_AI & Automation_**

[[Expandables]]
ML‑Assisted Triage | Models group related alerts and suppress obvious noise.
LLM‑Aided Rules | Research shows LLMs can draft candidate signatures from intel reports to speed coverage.
SOAR Actions | High‑confidence alerts trigger blocks, tickets, or notifications automatically.

## **Summary**

[[Icons]]
 | Cloud, enterprise, and edge benefit from signatures |
 | SIEM + IDS = context and speed |
 | AI and automation raise coverage and efficiency |
