##   **_What Is Cybersecurity?_**

**Cybersecurity** is the ongoing discipline of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital threats.  

It involves a mix of strategies, tools, and policies designed to:

- Prevent unauthorized access  
- Detect malicious or anomalous behavior  
- Respond to and recover from security incidents  

In effect, cybersecurity ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of information assets.

From IBM’s perspective, cybersecurity means safeguarding **people, systems, and data** using a coordinated set of technologies, processes, and policies.  

Because threats evolve constantly, cybersecurity is not a one-time setup — it’s an ongoing process of **monitoring, adapting, and defending**.

## **_Why It Matters: The Stakes at Each Level_**

Cyber threats don’t just affect one person or one system — they can scale up to affect entire organizations and governments.

[[FlipCards]]
Personal Level | Protect your identity, data, and devices — from smartphones to laptops.  
Organizational Level | Defend reputation, finances, trust, and IP.  
Government / National Level | Protect critical infrastructure and national security.

An effective defense requires **multiple layers** — covering data, applications, hardware, networks, and employees — supported by clear **incident response procedures**.

## **_Core Concepts & Models_**

[[Highlight: tone=indigo title=Defense in Depth / Multi-Layered Security]]
A robust cybersecurity approach includes overlapping controls at various layers (e.g., firewall, endpoint protection, intrusion detection, access control, encryption).

This ensures that if one layer fails, others continue to provide protection.

## **_The CIA Triad_**

A foundational model in information security is the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** triad:

- **Confidentiality** — Ensuring only authorized parties can access data
- **Integrity** — Ensuring data can’t be altered maliciously or accidentally
- **Availability** — Ensuring systems and data are accessible when neede

## **_Prevent / Detect / Mitigate_**

Cybersecurity controls can be classified by function:

[[Expandables]]
Preventive | controls that stop attacks (e.g., firewalls, access controls)  
Detective | controls that identify ongoing or past attacks (e.g., IDS, monitoring)  
Corrective / Mitigative | controls that respond, restore, or limit damage (e.g., incident response, backups)

These control types will map neatly into our later discussion of **signature-based detection** (a detective control) and how to respond to alerts.

## **_Threats & Motivations_**

Attackers have many goals, and many ways to execute them.  

Some common motives and methods include:

- **Financial gain** — stealing money, credit card data, or extortion through ransomware  
- **Identity theft** — impersonating victims, opening accounts or taking loans in their name  
- **Espionage / sabotage** — targeting corporate or national infrastructure  
- **Disruption** — denial-of-service attacks or infrastructure disruption  

Common attack vectors include:

[[Icons]]
 | Malware (viruses, trojans, ransomware) |
 | Social engineering and phishing |
 | Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks |
 | Zero-day exploits |
 | IoT vulnerabilities |
 | Injection attacks (SQL injection, cross-site scripting) |

Because attack techniques evolve, defenses must also evolve — which is why **signature-based systems** must be complemented by **anomaly detection approaches**.
