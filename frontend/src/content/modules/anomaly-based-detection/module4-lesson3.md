## 4.3 Summary and Review

Let us recap the essentials and tie them into a practical checklist.

### What you learned

- Baselines and features
  - How to craft stable, context aware signals for detection.

- Detection techniques
  - From simple statistics to ML models and hybrid stacks.

- Evaluation and tuning
  - Precision first, then expand recall with measured risk.

- Drift and lifecycle
  - Monitor distributions and respond with retune or retrain.

- Operations
  - Feedback, playbooks, and dashboards for sustainable scaling.

### Quick self check

- Can you describe point, contextual, and collective anomalies?
- Which metrics matter most for your analyst workload band?
- How would you detect and respond to mild drift vs a sudden shift?
- What guardrails prevent over automation from hiding incidents?

### A simple playbook outline

1. Triage the alert: confirm asset, owner, and business criticality.
2. Corroborate signals: auth logs, flows, endpoint, and change calendar.
3. Decide disposition: benign, true positive, or needs deeper look.
4. Capture labels and evidence: feed outcomes back to the pipeline.
5. Review thresholds and features if patterns repeat.

### Takeaway

Anomaly detection shines when paired with context, feedback loops, and a
disciplined operational cadence. Keep iterations small, observable, and
reversible.
