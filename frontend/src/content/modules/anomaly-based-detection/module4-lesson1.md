## 4.1 Best Practices

The best anomaly programs blend careful engineering with operational
discipline. Use these practices to improve signal quality and reduce noise.

### Engineering patterns

- Separate concerns
  - Keep ingest, feature computation, scoring, and alerting decoupled.

- Favor stable features
  - Prefer rates, deltas, and normalized measures over raw counts.

- Version everything
  - Models, feature schemas, thresholds, and calibration artifacts.

- Shadow before promote
  - Compare metrics side by side before flipping traffic.

- Automate validation
  - CI checks for schema drift, feature ranges, and scoring sanity.

### Operational habits

- Precision first
  - Build analyst trust by curbing early false positives.

- Document playbooks
  - Standard steps reduce variance and speed up triage.

- Label persistence
  - Store analyst outcomes to inform retrains and tuning.

- Drift watch
  - Maintain dashboards for score ranges, precision, and alert volume.

- Guardrails on automation
  - Time boxed suppressions and change audits.

### Collaboration

- Share context
  - Enrich alerts with asset criticality, owners, and recent changes.

- Feedback loops
  - Close the loop with platform and response teams on recurring patterns.

- Training
  - Upskill analysts on model basics and limitations.

### Takeaway

Consistency, observability, and human in the loop feedback are the foundation
of sustainable anomaly detection operations.
