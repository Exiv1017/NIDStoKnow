## **_Data Quality & Preparation_**

## **_Why Data Quality Matters_**
The best anomaly detection algorithms can be derailed by poor input data. If the data is incomplete, noisy, inconsistent, or corrupted, the detection system may mistake data errors for real anomalies — or miss meaningful ones altogether. Quality data is the foundation of trustworthy detection.

## **_Dimensions of Data Quality_**
When preparing data, pay attention to these essential attributes:
- Accuracy: The data should correctly represent real values or events.
- Completeness: Minimal missing or null entries.
- Consistency: No conflicting or contradictory records.
- Validity: Values fall within valid domains or conform to rules.
- Timeliness: Data is up-to-date and reflects the right time windows.
- Uniqueness: Avoid duplicate records.

These dimensions help ensure that the system works with reliable inputs.

## **_Common Data Issues That Mimic Anomalies_**
Before detection, you’ll often find problems that look like anomalies but stem from data defects:
- Missing or null fields
- Schema shifts (columns added or removed)
- Sudden jumps or drops in data volume
- Changes in data distribution
- Duplicate or redundant records
- Format or type mismatches
- Late or out-of-order entries

If left unchecked, these issues may trigger false alerts or hide real anomalies.

## **_Steps to Prepare Data for Detection_**
Here’s a way to get data ready:
- Profile and explore: gather basic statistics, visualize distributions, search for irregularities.
- Clean and filter: remove or impute missing values, eliminate duplicates, standardize formats.
- Transform and normalize: scale features, apply transformations (e.g. log, differencing) to reduce skew.
- Engineer features: derive useful metrics (e.g. rolling averages, rate of change), add contextual variables (time, category).
- Set aside reference data: use historical periods known to be “normal” for baseline creation; reserve subsets for validation.
- Validate and sanity-check: confirm that the cleaned data still retains meaningful behavior and did not discard real anomalies.

Data hygiene directly improves baseline stability and reduces alert fatigue.

## **_How This Supports Anomaly Detection_**
Well-prepared data leads to more stable baselines and sharper detection. When the input is trustworthy:
- False positives decrease (fewer spurious flags)
- False negatives reduce (real anomalies are visible)
- Baselines remain robust and less prone to drift

In short, good data preparation is not optional — it’s essential to reliable anomaly detection.
