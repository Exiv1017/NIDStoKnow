## 4.2 Future Directions

Anomaly detection continues to evolve. These trends and techniques are likely
to shape the next few years of practice.

### Emerging approaches

- Selfâ€‘supervised representations
  - Learn robust embeddings from unlabeled logs and flows.

- Explainability by design
  - Attribution and exemplars built into model outputs.

- Continual learning
  - Incremental updates that adapt without full retrains.

- Hybrid stacks
  - Signatures, heuristics, and anomaly models for complementary coverage.

- Causality cues
  - Graph and temporal causal hints to reduce spurious correlations.

### Platform patterns

- Feature stores
  - Reusable, versioned features with validation and lineage.

- Real time plus batch fusion
  - Fast path for triage, batch for deeper retrospective scoring.

- Policy aware scoring
  - Align thresholds with business risk and asset criticality.

- Governance
  - Model cards, audits, and change logs as first class artifacts.

### Challenges ahead

- Data privacy and compliance boundaries
  - Federated or privacy preserving learning in sensitive domains.

- Label scarcity
  - Active learning and smarter feedback collection.

- Adversarial pressure
  - Robustness against slowly morphing attacker behaviors.

### Takeaway

Expect stronger emphasis on explainability, governance, and safe automation,
with anomaly models embedded as services alongside traditional controls.
