## 3.1 Types of Anomalies

Not all anomalies are alike. Recognizing types helps tailor strategies.

### Point anomalies

A single data point differs sharply from the rest.

- Example: readings near 30 °C and one at 100 °C.

### Contextual (conditional) anomalies

A point is anomalous only within a context (time, season, or role).

- Example: high traffic at 03:00 is abnormal; at 15:00 it is normal.

### Collective anomalies

A group of points together is anomalous even if each alone is not.

- Example: a short sequence of error codes indicating failure.

These distinctions matter because different methods capture different types.
Contextual and collective anomalies can be missed by point‑only methods.
