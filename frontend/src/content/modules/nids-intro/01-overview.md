# What is a NIDS?

Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) monitor network traffic to detect suspicious activity. They analyze packet headers and payloads at network choke points to identify patterns that match known attack signatures or anomalies.

- Role: monitor, analyze, detect suspicious traffic
- Typical placement: network choke points (e.g., backbone links, DMZ)
- Output: alerts, logs, context for analysts

Learning objective: After this lesson you'll be able to describe what a NIDS is and where it is placed in a network.

**Activity:** Reflection â€” write one sentence where a NIDS would be placed in your network.
