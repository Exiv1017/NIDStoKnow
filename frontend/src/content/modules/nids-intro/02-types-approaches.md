# Types of IDS and Approaches

- Host-based IDS (HIDS): runs on endpoints and inspects host logs and processes.
- Network-based IDS (NIDS): monitors network traffic for suspicious patterns.

Detection methods:
- Signature-based: matches known patterns (our course focus)
- Anomaly-based: models normal behavior and flags deviations
- Hybrid: combines both approaches

Transition: In this course, we will focus on the Signature-Based method, one of the most widely used approaches.

Learning objective: Be able to differentiate HIDS vs NIDS and describe signature vs anomaly approaches.

**Activity:** Quick quiz â€” pick which IDS type inspects host logs vs network packets.
